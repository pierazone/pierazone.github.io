PIERA-ZONE makes it easier for educators to conduct fair digital exams for FREE with an easy to use interface and clear workflow of the entire process from creation, conduction, evaluation to sharing and working with results. It has been created by keeping individual use in mind, but we do provide a basic setup for an institution with a basic hierarchy who would like to have a login and log of user activity.

# KEY FEATURES

- Candidates can not perform any other activity on the system than the exam, doing otherwise leads to immediate termination of the exam without prior warning, thus reducing a possibility of malpractice.

- Examiners can create exams by giving in the basic details and the rest is automated. Sharing the exam with the candidates can be done by sharing a single file via any means.

- Examiners can evaluate the results with a tap of a button which automatically generates shareable PDF results that can be shared with the candidates by any means or use our built in feature to send it via email automatically whenever they wish to. They can also modify the exam key and re-evaluate as many times as they wish to.

- Exams can be conducted without the need to have internet connection as all the processes happen locally. An attempt to email the responses of the candidates will be made to the email ID provided during the exam creation, but if the internet is disconnected or this feature has been disabled during exam creation or any other reason of failure of the same, student can find a local copy of their responses which can be shared later by any means as instructed.

- All the results after final evaluation are stored in the database, which can be viewed through our application and can also be exported as an excel file.

- Candidates have a choice to mark questions for review during the exam which can later be visited and revised. Color indicators have been used to indicate if they have seen the question but haven’t attempted, attempted the question by marking/entering an answer, attempted and marked for review or haven't attempted and marked for review. They can navigate to any question using the navigation pane consisting of option menus for the same.

- Questions of type single correct answer and multiple correct answers (out of 4 options), numerical or text, and/or a combination of all is facilitated.

- Easily switch between usage type of individual or an organisation.

- Exams and reading the instructions before an exam are time bound as specified during the exam creation, after which the exam will auto submit and launch the exam respectively.
