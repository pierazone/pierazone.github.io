<h3 id="analyzing-results">ANALYZING RESULTS<a class="headerlink" href="#analyzing-results" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p><img alt="results" src="https://pierazone.github.io/resources/v1.2.1-screenshots/results.png" /></p>
<p>All the results are stored in the form of shareable PDF files to individual candidates at location mentioned in the above section, you may use the inbuilt feature to email them to the students automatically.

<p>This can be configured using the <code>Configure</code> button on the bottom right corner of the initial screen. The major difference between the two modes is the option of logging in, if you are using it as an individual it is quite obvious that you will not need the option mentioned earlier, but if you are a simple organisation, having a simple hierarchy this feature could be very useful. Both of the modes use separate databases, and hence this can be used for personal purposes even at the workplace. You will find the “organisation” mode exclusive features in an upcoming section.</p>

<p><code>Sign Up</code>: Use this to create a new account by filling the sign up form that appears next, all the entry labels have usual meaning, and a single email ID cannot be used by 2 users.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Log data in Database</strong>: A table in the database will contain the user activities log of account creation and deletion, and login. This data can not be seen via our software, you may use a database management tool to view the same.</p>

<hr />
<h1 id="workarounds">WORKAROUNDS<a class="headerlink" href="#workarounds" title="Permanent link"></a></h1>
<p>Here are some interesting things that you do with the software, but indirectly.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>You can take text as an input from the students and have a blank key for evaluation, you can evaluate the exam and then view the student responses and manually edit the key and re-evaluate every individual response before sharing the final result with them. This method will definitely not be able to tabulate the details in the database, or provide cumulative results, but if you have got time and dedication then you can do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You will find that the results are having a number at the beginning of every file, you can sort the folder by alphabets to bring them in order, you will also find <code>_&lt;name&gt; Emails_.txt</code> file along with the PDFs, here the email IDs are in the same order, you can use this to retrieve any email ID if needed for any purpose or maybe modify them if any candidate puts up a request to change the same.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Students (examinee) can observe that there will be a <code>__History__</code> folder in the <code>My Exams</code> folder. You will find all details of the exams (including the question paper) that you have given earlier, and if you wish to give an exam again, take the <code>.pznx</code> file of the exam and paste it back into the <code>My Exams</code> folder, and you are good to go. You may delete the contents of this folder to free up some space.</p>
</li>
